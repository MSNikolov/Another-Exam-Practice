Another practice for the Fundamentals Exam, which takes place on 06. August. Problem descriptions: https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/Practice/Index/1597#0 On the first problem I got 90/100 due to compile time error - I did not have the time to find out why. The Emoji Simulator was a task for my previous practice so I skipped it this time. The International Softuniada was an interesting one, which I solved with a nested dictionary - normally I would not do this but I decided to give it a try and it worked.
